<h2> What are the ingredients for a sandwich </h2>
The Ingredients to Cereal is simple, have a bowl, a spoon, some milk and whhatever cereal you got! When someone says eating cereal, you mostly think of breakfast, and nothing else. 
But Cereal can be eaten anytime throughout the day, but it's most common in the morning. These are some

 <h2> Preparation for Cereal </h2>
So the preparation of cereal is really easy. You get out your bowl, then open your milk, pour howver much milk you want. Close the milk, put it back in the fridge
then open your cereal. After this, pour however much cereal you want in your bowl of milk. You can pour cereal or milk first, it doesn't matter. If you can't follow
these instructions, here's a video to <a href="https://youtu.be/SoGD_l-kt-U">guide</a>
	 
	   <h2> What to do during your eating time </h2>
There are many things that you cna do while eating your delicious bowl of cereal. You can be doing homework, watching videos on youtube, even eating cereal while gaming.
During your gaming session, just take a bite or two here and there. But watching a video or an anime episode might be good because you can just have it laying on a solid 
piece just playing as you're eating cereal.
